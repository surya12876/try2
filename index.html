        <h3>Common Menstrual problems</h3>
        <p>Menstrual cycles often bring about a variety of uncomfortable symptoms leading up to your period.
            <br>
            However, other, more serious menstrual problems may also occur. Menstruation that is too heavy or too light, or the complete absence of a cycle, may suggest that there are other issues that are contributing to an abnormal menstrual cycle.
